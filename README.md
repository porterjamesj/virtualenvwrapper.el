# virtualenvwrapper.el

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/porterjamesj/virtualenvwrapper.el.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/porterjamesj/virtualenvwrapper.el)

[![MELPA](http://melpa.org/packages/virtualenvwrapper-badge.svg)](http://melpa.org/#/virtualenvwrapper)

A featureful virtualenv tool for Emacs. Emulates
much of the functionality of Doug Hellmann's
[virtualenvwrapper](https://bitbucket.org/dhellmann/virtualenvwrapper/).

## Features

* Works with the new
  [python.el](https://github.com/fgallina/python.el), which is the
  default on Emacs 24.3 and up. Does not support the older python
  modes.
* Python shells, interactive shells, eshell, and any other subprocesses can
  be made aware of your virtualenvs.
* Implements a large subset of the functionality of virtualenvwrapper.

## Basic Usage

* Obviously make sure you have
  [virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/) installed. You
  don't actually need virtualenvwrapper.sh, this is a reimplementation
  in Emacs lisp.
* Install from MELPA (`M-x package-install virtualenvwrapper`),
  or just put `virtualenvwrapper.el` on your load path somewhere.
* Put

  ```lisp
  (require 'virtualenvwrapper)
  (venv-initialize-interactive-shells) ;; if you want interactive shell support
  (venv-initialize-eshell) ;; if you want eshell support
  (setq venv-location "/path/to/your/virtualenvs/")
  ```

  in your config somewhere.

* Use `M-x venv-workon` to activate virtualenvs and `M-x
  venv-deactivate` deactivate them.
* If you have your virtualenvs spread around the filesystem rather
  than in one directory, just set venv-location to be a list of
  paths to each virtualenv. For example:

  ```lisp
  (setq venv-location '("/path/to/project1-env/"
                        "/path/to/ptoject2-env/"))
  ```

  Notice that the final directory of each path has a different name.
  The mode uses this fact to disambiguate virtualenvs from each other,
  so for now it is required.
* You can also change easily the virtual environment location with
  `M-x venv-set-location`. This is particularly useful when working with
  tools such as [tox](https://testrun.org/tox/latest/) that generate virtual
  environments dynamically.

## What do activating and deactivating actually do?

Many virtual environment support tools describe their functionality as
"it just works" or "it's so simple". This is not descriptive enough to
figure out what's wrong when something inevitably breaks, so here I
will describe *exactly* what happens when you activate a virtualenv:

1. `python-shell-virtualenv-path` is set to the virtualenv's directory
   so that when you open a new python shell, it is aware of the
   virtual environment's installed packages and modules.
2. The virtualenv's `bin` directory is prepended to the `PATH`
   environment variable so that when a process is launched from Emacs
   it is aware of any executables installed in the virtualenv (such as
   `nosetests`, `pep8`, etc.). This comes in handy because you can do
   `M-! nosetests` to run your tests, for example.
3. The `VIRTUAL_ENV` environment variable is set to the virtualenv's
   directory so that any tools that depend on this variable function
   correctly (one such tool is
   [jedi](http://tkf.github.io/emacs-jedi/)).
4. The virtualenv's `bin` directory is added to the `exec-path`, so that
   Emacs itself can find the environment's installed executables. This is
   useful, for example, if you want to have Emacs spawn a subprocess
   running an executable installed in a virtualenv.

When you deactivate, all these things are undone. You can safely
modify your `PATH` and `exec-path` while a virtualenv is active and
expect the changes not to be destroyed.

This covers everything except interactive shells, which are
covered in the next section.

## Shells

This thing supports two types of interactive shells, the
[eshell](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eshell.html)
and the
[interactive subshell](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Interactive-Shell.html)
(what you get when you do `M-x shell`).

### Interactive shell

Support for interactive shell is turned on by calling
`venv-initialize-interactive-shell`. After this is done, whenever you
call `shell`, the shell will start in the correct virtualenv. This
detects whether or not you have virtualenvwrapper.sh installed and does
the right thing in either case.  Note that changing the virtualenv in
Emacs will not affect any running shells and vice-versa; they are
independent processes.

#### WARNINGS

This feature is a pretty big hack and works by
[advising](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Advising-Functions.html)
the `shell` function. This works fine if you haven't otherwise tricked
out or advised it, but if this is the case it may break. Please file
an issue if you encounter any bugs with this functionality, I am
interested to see how robust it is.

### Eshell

support for eshell is turned on by calling `venv-initialize-eshell`.
After doing this, any new eshells you launch will be in the correct
virtualenv and have access to installed executables, etc. The mode
also provides a variety of virtualenvwrapper commands that work
identically to their bash/zsh counterparts (described in detail
below). Note that in contrast to how interactive shells work, Eshell
shares an environment with Emacs, so if you activate or deactivate in
one, the other is affected as well. Note that this requires the
variable `eshell-modify-global-environment` to be set to true. Running
`venv-initialize-eshell` causes this to occur. If this doesn't work for
you, open an issue! It's technically possible to separate the two, but
it requires some hacking around with the different namespaces that I
won't bother to do unless someone really needs it.

## Command Reference

The commands this mode provides are prefixed with `venv-`
All commands can be called interactively using `M-x`. All of these
comamnds have also been aliased without prefixes as eshell functions,
so you can call them on the eshell just as you would in bash or zsh.
For example:

```
eshell> workon myenv
eshell> deactivate
eshell> cpvirtualenv env copy
eshell> mkvirtualenv newenv
```

All will do what would expect.

#### `venv-workon`

Prompts for the name of a virtualenv and activates it as described
above. Can also be called noninteractively as `(venv-workon "name")`.

When called, it sets `gud-pdb-command-name` to `python -m pdb` so that
`M-x pdb` can be used inside the virtual environment.

#### `venv-deactivate`

Deactivates your current virtualenv, undoing everything that `venv-workon`
did. This can also be called noninteractively as `(venv-deactivate)`.

When called, it sets `gud-pdb-command-name` to its default value
(usually `pdb`).

#### `venv-mkvirtualenv`

Prompt for a name and create a new virtualenv. If your virtualenvs are
all kept in the same directory (i.e. `venv-location` is a string),
then the new virtualenv will be created in that directory. If you keep
your virtualenvs in different places (i.e. `venv-location` is a
list), then the new virtualenv will be created in the current default
directory. Also callable noninteractively as `(venv-mkvirtualenv
"name")`.

#### `venv-rmvirtualenv`

Prompt for the name of a virutalenv and delete it. Also callable
noninteractively as `(venv-rmvirtualenv "name")`.

#### `venv-lsvirtualenv`

Display all available virtualenvs in a help buffer. Also callable
noninteractively as `(venv-list-virtualenvs)`.

#### `venv-cdvirtualenv`

Change the current default directory to the current virtualenv's
directory. If called noninteractively, you can optionally provide an
argument, which is interpreted as a subdirectory. For example, to go
to the `bin` directory of the currently active virtualenv, call
`(venv-cdvirtualenv "bin")`.

#### `venv-cpvirtualenv`

Makes a new virtualenv that is a copy of an existing one. Prompts for
the names of both. *WARNING* This comes with the same caveat as the
corresponding command in the original virtualenvwrapper, which is that
some packages hardcode their locations when being installed, so
creating new virtualenvs in this manner may cause them to break. Use
with caution.


## Useful Macros

There is a `venv-with-virtualenv` macro, which takes the name of a
virtualenv and then any number of forms and executes those forms with
that virtualenv active, in that virtualenv's directory.  For example:

```lisp
(venv-with-virtualenv "myenv" (message default-directory))
```

Will message the path of `myenv`'s directory. There's also a
`venv-all-virtualenv` macro, which takes a series of forms, activates
each virtualenv in turn, moves to its directory, and executes the
given forms.

Since it's common to want to execute shell commands, there are
convenience macros, `venv-with-virtualenv-shell-command` and
`venv-allvirtualenv-shell-command`, which take a string, interpreted
as a shell command, and do exactly what you'd expect. So for example,
you can do `(venv-allvirtualenv-shell-command "pip install pep8")` to
install `pep8` in all virtualenvs. `venv-allvirtualenv-shell-command`
can also be called interactively and will prompt for a command to run
if so.

The eshell supports using this command just like in bash or zsh, so at
an eshell prompt, you can just do:

```
eshell> allvirtualenv pip install pep8
```

And it will do what you expect.


## Extras

This mode doesn't screw with things you probably have customized
yourself, such as your mode line, keybindings, mode-hooks, etc. in
order to provide stuff like automatically turning on virtualenvs in
certain projects, show the virtualenv on the mode line, etc. Instead,
you can do all these things pretty easily using tools already provided
by Emacs. How to do some of them are described below.

### Keybindings

This mode doesn't provide any. I don't presume to know how you want
your keybindings, you can bind them to whatever you want! Go crazy!

### Hooks

Virtualenvwrapper lets you write shell scripts that run as hooks after
you take certain actions, such as creating or deleting a
virtualenv. This package provides Emacs
[hooks](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Hooks.html),
to achieve the same thing. The complete list of hooks is:

```
venv-premkvirtualenv-hook
venv-postmkvirtualenv-hook
venv-prermvirtualenv-hook
venv-postrmvirtualenv-hook
venv-preactivate-hook
venv-postactivate-hook
venv-predeactivate-hook
venv-postdeactivate-hook
```

each of which is run when you would expect based on the name.

For example, to install commonly used packages when a new virtualenv is
created you could modify the `venv-postmkvirtualenv-hook` as follows:

```lisp
(add-hook 'venv-postmkvirtualenv-hook
          (lambda () (shell-command "pip install nose flake8 jedi")))
```

### Automatically activating a virtualenv in a particular project

It's also common to want to have a virtualenv automatically activated
when you open a file in a certain project. This mode provides no
special way to do this because once again Emacs has already done it in
the form of
[per-directory local variables](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Directory-Variables.html)
and
[mode hooks](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Hooks.html). In
order to have a virtualenv automatically activated when you open a
python file in a particular project, you could put a `.dir-locals.el` in the
project's root directory with something like:

```lisp
((python-mode . ((project-venv-name . "myproject-env"))))
```

Now whenever you open one of this project's python files, you will
have a variable `project-venv-name` set to the name of the project's
virtualenv. In order to cause this venv to be activated
automatically, we can just add a python-mode hook:

```lisp
(add-hook 'python-mode-hook (lambda ()
                              (hack-local-variables)
                              (when (boundp 'project-venv-name)
                                (venv-workon project-venv-name))))
```

The call to `hack-local-variables` is necessary because by default
mode-hooks are run before directory local variables are set, so we
have to do that explicitly in the hook in order to have access to
them.

### Automatically activating a virtualenv when using projectile

If you're using [projectile](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile)
there's an easier way to automatically activate a virtualenv when
entering a project.

You just have to call `(venv-projectile-auto-workon)` after switching
projects, this can be achieved hooking the call to the action
`projectile-switch-project-action` like this:

```lisp
(setq projectile-switch-project-action 'venv-projectile-auto-workon)
```

If you relay on another use for this action, then just add a `lambda`
instead:

```lisp
(setq projectile-switch-project-action
      '(lambda ()
         (venv-projectile-auto-workon)
         (projectile-find-file)))
```

As long as a virtualenv is found in the `projectile-project-root` and
whose name is `.venv` it will be automatically activated. If you tend
to name your virtualenvs differently (e.g. _pyenv_ or _.virtual_) just
be sure to add those extra names to the `venv-dirlookup-names` list.

```lisp
(setq venv-dirlookup-names '(".venv" "pyenv" ".virtual"))
```

You can add as many names you need, the first one found in the current
project will be activated.

### Displaying the currently active virtualenv on the mode line

The name of the currently active virtualenv is stored in the variable
`venv-current-name`. If you want to have it displayed on your custom
mode line you can just add `(:exec (list venv-current-name)))`
somewhere in your `mode-line-format`. If you don't customize your mode
line and just want to have the current virtualenv displayed, you can
do:

```lisp
(setq-default mode-line-format (cons '(:exec venv-current-name) mode-line-format))
```

### Eshell prompt customization

You also might want to have the name of your current virtualenv appear
on the eshell prompt. You can do this by a pretty similar mechanism,
just include `venv-current-name` in your `eshell-prompt-function`
somewhere. Here is a simple example of a prompt that includes the
current virtualenv name followed by a dollar sign:

```lisp
(setq eshell-prompt-function
    (lambda ()
      (concat venv-current-name " $ ")))
```

Make sure you also adjust your `eshell-prompt-regexp` if you do this.

### Bugs / Comments / Contributions

Open an issue or a PR! I'm happy to pull in contributions or take
suggestions for improvements.

### Hacking

I use [Cask](http://cask.github.io/) to manage dependencies and
[ert-runner](https://github.com/rejeep/ert-runner.el) for testing. To
get started:

1. [install cask](http://cask.github.io/installation/)
2. Install dependacies with `cask install --dev`
3. Verify that the tests pass with `cask exec ert-runner`

The tests are pretty rudimentary integration tests but they verify that
all the basic functionality works.

If you're planning on submitting a PR, please make sure that the tests pass
before you do so. Thanks!
